# Reviewing of Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow

This project is my personal reviewing and studying of Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow (Second Edition). It contains the example codes provided in each one of the chapters, some additional advances note I made, and the solutions of the excercises at the end of the chapter.
